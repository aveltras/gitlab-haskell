# A Haskell library for the GitLab web API

A library that interacts with a GitLab server's API. It supports
queries about and updates to:

* Branches
* Commits
* Groups
* Issues
* Jobs
* Members
* Merge requests
* Pipelines
* Projects
* Repositories

The library parses JSON results into Haskell data types in the
`GitLab.Types` module.
